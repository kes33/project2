Kim and Ben evenly divided up the work for part D. Ben and Kim wrote the pseudocode for
the select function together and evenly divided the implementation. We wrote our code to
follow the specifications.

Please note that for our Part D submission, we are also re-submitting BTreeNode.h,
BTreeNode.cc, and BTreeIndex.cc. The large majority of changes were to remove
or comment out print statements used for debugging, but we also added a constructor for
BTLeafNode. The file-by-file changes and the reasons for including them are described
below:

BTreeNode.h
    - added BTLeafNode() constructor

BTreeNode.cc
    - added BTLeafNode constructor. We found a bug in BTLeafNode's insert function while
    calling the load function: the first time a leaf node is created, if no "read" call is
    done, the buffer was being left uninitialized, and an incorrect reading of
    getKeyCount() resulted, leading to a segmentation fault.  This was fixed by
    initializing the key count to 0 upon construction
    - all other changes were to remove or comment out print statements used for debugging

BTreeIndex.cc
    - all changes were to remove or comment out print statements used for debugging
