Kim and Ben evenly divided up the work for part D. Ben and Kim wrote the pseudocode for select together and evenly divided the implementation.

Please note that for our Part D submission, we are also re-submitting BTreeNode.h, BTreeNode.cc, BTreeIndex.h and BTreeIndex.cc. The large majority of changes were to remove or comment out print statements used for debugging, but we also added a constructor for BTLeafNode and a short function for BTreeIndex. The file-by-file changes and the reasons for including them are described below:

BTreeNode.h
    - added BTLeafNode() constructor

BTreeNode.cc
    - added BTLeafNode constructor
			->we found a bug in BTLeafNode insert while calling the load function: the first time a leaf node
          	is created, if no "read" call is done, the buffer was being left uninitialized, and an incorrect
			reading of getKeyCount() resulted, leading to a segmentation fault.  This was fixed by initializing	
			the key count to 0 upon construction
    - all other changes were to remove or comment out print statements used for debugging

BTreeIndex.h
    - all other changes were to remove or comment out print statements used for debugging
